You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients. As a Staff Data Scientist, you will contribute meaningfully through leading others. Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few. Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our Data Scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them. You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to complex, multi-layered, impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing and anticipate problems that may be several degrees removed from obvious requirements. You make your team better by proactively advocating for and driving improvements not just to what the team produces, but also the ways in which the team works. You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work.

We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques. You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents. You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences. Preferred, a BS/MS with 12 years or a PhD with 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role.

639,S&P Global,4.1,Lead Data Scientist,104k - 206k ,"Chicago, IL","MI/Panjiva is a data-driven technology company that uses machine learning to extract insights from global trade data. This unstructured data describes the behavior of the many real-world entities such as companies, products, and ports, that make up international trade in goods across borders. Our technology and expertise allow us to extract and link these entities from our database of billions of individual records. This data feeds the Panjiva platform, through which we provide powerful search, analysis, and visualization capabilities to our customers.

Panjiva’s data helps power the decisions of our thousands of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, hedge funds, and logistics providers, in addition to universities, government agencies, and NGOs.

The Data Science team builds tools and models that enable the Panjiva platform. Our data scientists work with highly complex, often unstructured, multidimensional data from dozens of countries in many different languages. We use NLP, clustering, classification, regressions and a host of other algorithms / ML tools to curate and extract insight from our data. All of this work directly feeds our site, giving our customers the tools they need to answer their toughest questions.

Data Science is core to the value Panjiva provides our customers. As an example, we built a custom text classification model that better handles rare terms (think Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly), multiple languages, and misspellings that traditional language embedding techniques struggle with. This model allows our customers to search our data by industry standard product categories, rather than relying on text-based searches.

We are seeking talented data scientists to join our team.

Large-scale clustering entity resolution and fuzzy text matching

Document classification via natural language processing

Imputation of missing values

Anomaly detection, trend prediction, and modeling on the global supply chain network

Work and speak with customers to build solutions catered to their needs

Qualifications:
7+ years of relevant IT/Development/Data Science experience
Thorough understanding of statistical, analytical, and machine-learning techniques, including deep learning
Ability to conduct independent and rigorous work from loose specifications
Track record of providing valuable insights into large, multidimensional datasets

This unstructured data describes the behavior of the many real-world entities such as companies, products, and ports, that make up international trade in goods across borders. Our technology and expertise allow us to extract and link these entities from our database of billions of individual records. This data feeds the Panjiva platform, through which we provide powerful search, analysis, and visualization capabilities to our customers.

Panjiva’s data helps power the decisions of our thousands of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, hedge funds, and logistics providers, in addition to universities, government agencies, and NGOs.

The Data Science team builds tools and models that enable the Panjiva platform. Our data scientists work with highly complex, often unstructured, multidimensional data from dozens of countries in many different languages. We use NLP, clustering, classification, regressions and a host of other algorithms / ML tools to curate and extract insight from our data. All of this work directly feeds our site, giving our customers the tools they need to answer their toughest questions.

Data Science is core to the value Panjiva provides our customers. As an example, we built a custom text classification model that better handles rare terms (think Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly), multiple languages, and misspellings that traditional language embedding techniques struggle with. This model allows our customers to search our data by industry standard product categories, rather than relying on text-based searches.

This unstructured data describes the behavior of the many real-world entities such as companies, products, and ports, that make up international trade in goods across borders. Our technology and expertise allow us to extract and link these entities from our database of billions of individual records. This data feeds the Panjiva platform, through which we provide powerful search, analysis, and visualization capabilities to our customers.

Panjiva’s data helps power the decisions of our thousands of clients, including Fortune 500 companies, hedge funds, and logistics providers, in addition to universities, government agencies, and NGOs.

The Data Science team builds tools and models that enable the Panjiva platform. Our data scientists work with highly complex, often unstructured, multidimensional data from dozens of countries in many different languages. We use NLP, clustering, classification, regressions and a host of other algorithms / ML tools to curate and extract insight from our data. All of this work directly feeds our site, giving our customers the tools they need to answer their toughest questions.

Data Science is core to the value Panjiva provides our customers. As an example, we built a custom text classification model that better handles rare terms (think Aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly), multiple languages, and misspellings that traditional language embedding techniques struggle with. This model allows our customers to search our data by industry standard product categories, rather than relying on text-based searches.

We are seeking talented data scientists to join our team.
